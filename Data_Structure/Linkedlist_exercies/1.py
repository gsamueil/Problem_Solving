"""
Write a code in the language of your choice to implement a singly linked list. A singly linked list has the following properties:

Each node contains a piece of data.
    [Node class] 
                constructor  takes a value as an argument and initializes the value attribute of the node.

                Each node also holds a reference (or link) to the next node in the list.
                A  next attribute, initialized to None, which will store a reference to the next node in the list.
=================================================================================================================

   [LinkedList] class 
        constructor  takes a value as an argument and creates new node object based on Node class with that value.

        head and tail attributes of the linked list to point to the new node.

        A length attribute, initialized to 1, which represents the current number of nodes in the list.
